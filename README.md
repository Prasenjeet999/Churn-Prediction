## Problem Statement

In today's competitive business landscape, customer retention is paramount for sustainable growth and success. Our challenge is to develop a predictive model that can identify customers who are at risk of churning â€“ discontinuing their use of our service. 

Customer churn can lead to significant revenue loss and market share decline. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to build a model that accurately predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on their historical usage behavior, demographic information, and subscription details.

Customer Retention

This predictive model will allow us to proactively target high-risk customers with personalized retention strategies, ultimately helping us:

- Enhance customer satisfaction
- Reduce churn rates
- Optimize our business strategies

Our goal is to create an effective solution that contributes to the long-term success of our company by fostering customer loyalty and engagement.

## Data Description

Our dataset consists of customer information for churn prediction, including:

- CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
- Name: Customer's name
- Age: Customer's age
- Gender: Customer's gender (Male or Female)
- Location: Customer's location (Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, New York)
- Subscription_Length_Months: Number of months subscribed
- Monthly_Bill: Monthly bill amount
- Total_Usage_GB: Total usage in gigabytes
- Churn: Binary indicator (1 or 0) of customer churn

Data Description

## Tech Stack Used

Our project utilizes a comprehensive tech stack for data analysis, modeling, and machine learning:

- Python Programming Language
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-Learn (sklearn)
- TensorFlow & Keras
- Various ML algorithms (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)
- Advanced techniques (PCA, GridSearchCV, Cross-Validation)

Tech Stack

## Outcome

The outcome of this project is a machine learning model capable of predicting customer churn. This model:

- Analyzes various customer attributes
- Identifies high-risk customers
- Enables proactive retention measures
- Helps optimize resource allocation and engagement strategies

Project Outcome

By leveraging this model, we aim to significantly reduce churn rates, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize our overall customer retention strategies.
